<h1>Software Engineer Ablities, Skills, and Artistry</h1>
<p>In the YouTube video, “Software Engineer: Reality vs Expectations 3 (ft. Mayuko)”, Matt Tran interviews Mayuko, a software engineer who specializes in IOS software. She has worked at a company with thousands of employees and currently works at a company with about 80 employees. Mayuko comments on five things that she has learned while working in the field.</p>
<ul>
<li>Software engineers collaborate most of the time. This is addressed in the Web, Data, and Design syllabus in the partnership requirements and the peer assessments. Mayuko directly references having others review work so that the best product is put out.</li>
<li>Soft skills are as important as technical skills. Although the video does not define “soft skills” they are generally considered to include communication, problem-solving, creativity, adaptability, and a strong work ethic. This is addressed in the sections on arriving on time, staying for the whole class, and contacting the professor immediately if there is an issue with attendance. Also, being prepared for class with all required materials and turning in assignments on time.</li>
<li>You don’t have to be a stereotype to succeed as a software engineer. Although there is no direct parallel in the syllabus, the title of the class includes the word “design”. Design allows for the personality of the creator to be expressed in their work.</li>
<li>Be open and able to explore all the possibilities. The ability to use external sources to complete assignments.</li>
<li>Empathy for your coworkers and end users is important. This also falls into the soft skills section.</li>
</ul>
